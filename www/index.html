<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview of the Mensuration package</h2>

<p> The <Rpkg>Mensuration</Rpkg> package is a small package of routines that might be
  helpful for some projects related to forest mensuration. The package as it stands is
  very incomplete and currently revolves around
  two <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/"><Rpkg>Shiny</Rpkg></a> applications that run in
  the user's web browser. These allow the interactive exploration of so-called <em>q</em>
  distributions and the more flexible Chapman-Richards distribution. A few "helper"
  routines are potentially useful in their own right.
</p>

<p> Details of package use are found in the package vignette: <Rclass>The R Mensuration
	Package User's Guide</Rclass>, while the help system is detailed in the normal package
	vignette. Information on installation and a simple example are found in the following
	sections. Please refer to the vignettes for more details.
</p>	  






<!-- ============================================================================================== -->
<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Mensuration package installation</h2>


<p> <Rpkg>Mensuration</Rpkg> is available only on R-Forge. On the project pages, you will
    note that you can install the package directly from R-Forge using&hellip; <br><br>

<Rcode>install.packages("Mensuration", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")</Rcode><br><br>

Currently, the <Rpkg>Mensuration</Rpkg> package relies on the R Shiny package.
</p>

<p> In order to use the Shiny applications, the <Rpkg>Mensuration</Rpkg> package requires
    that the following package be installed prior to use. It is best to install the most
    recent version from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> as&hellip;<br><br>

  <Rcode>install.packages("shiny")</Rcode><br><br>

    An optional package that will present tables in a more useable manner (see examples
    below) is the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/"><Rpkg>DT</Rpkg> package</a>,
    which supports JavaScript "DataTables"; this package is recommend and can be installed
    with&hellip;<br><br>

  <Rcode>install.packages("DT")</Rcode><br><br>

</p>




<h3><Rpkg>Mensuration</Rpkg> package vignette</h3>

<p>
As noted above, there is one extra package vignette (aside from the default help vignette)
distributed with the package itself. Both can also be downloaded here from the R-Forge
versions if desired&hellip;
</p>

<h2><a name="Examples"></a>Mensuration examples</h2>


<p>
Several examples of the supporting functions are shown in the package vignette cited
above. Because of the interavtive nature of Shiny applications, only a screen shot of each
application is shown here. Again, a more detailed narrative on each application is found
in the package vignette. The best course of action is to simply install the package and
its dependency (Shiny) and give it a try.
</p>


<h3><Rcode>qDistnShiny</Rcode></h3>

<p> The following is a snapshot of the interface that allows one to explore
  different <em>q</em> distibutions using the sliders to the left&hellip;
</p>

<!-- qDistnShiny -->
<div id='qDistnShiny'>
<!--<a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/mensuration/">-->
<img src="./figures/qDistnShiny.png" width="100%"/> </a>
</div>




<h3><Rcode>crDistnShiny</Rcode></h3>

<p> Similarly to the above, the following is a snapshot of the interface that allows one
  to explore different Chapman-Richards distibutions using the sliders to the left; the
  following shows a "rotated-sigmoid" distribution accompanied by the basal area-size
  distribution (BASD); which are the defaults at creation time&hellip;
</p>

<!-- crDistnShiny -->
<div id='crDistnShiny'>
<!--<a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/mensuration/">-->
<img src="./figures/crDistnShiny.png" width="100%"/> </a>
</div>

<p> Note that the sliders are used to set the parameters of the Chapman-Richards growth
  equations (eta, m, and gamma) and the two other vital rates of the distribution:
  "Recruitment" and "Mortality rate." More information on these parameter values and how
  they affect the growth and resulting distributional shapes is given in the vignette and
  the paper cited above. Also note that the figure shows all trees down to the very
  smallest in the first class (in order to capture most of the numbers density in that
  class near zero), which we are told is wider than the nominal width; this option may be
  selected by calling the routine using: <Rcode>crDistnShiny(d0 = 0.001, includeTiny =
  TRUE)</Rcode> (see the help page for more information on these and other arguments). We
  are also told that the largest class is different from the nominal size, this results
  because the Chapman-Richards growth model has a maximum size limit, which is inherited
  by the distribution. The quadratic mean stand diameter is shown on both distributions
  with the small red tick mark.
</p>

<p>The above is accompanied by the basal area-size distribution on the right of the
  figure. In the next figure, the distribution is the same, but we have clicked on the
  "MortSurv" tab in the upper right, to show the survival probability and the mortality
  distribution&hellip;
</p>

<img src="./figures/crDistnShinyWithMortality.png" width="100%"/> </a>
</div>


<p>Finally, the following is again the same distribution, but showing the stand table
  view, much like what is shown by default in the <Rcode>qDistnShiny</Rcode> application&hellip;
</p>

<!-- crDistnShiny With Stand Table -->
<div id='crDistnShiny'>

</div>



<h3> Summary </h3>

<p> There are a number of other options for both of the Shiny applications illustrated
  above---these are detailed in the package help pages, as are the other routines
  available in the package. Both of the Shiny applications allow the user to explore the
  results on distributional shape by changing the parameters for the respective
  distribitions interactively in real time. The <em>q</em> distribution will always have a
  negative exponential shape, but one can vary the diminution coefficient as well as the
  other parameters to see what affect these changes have on the final stand structure. The
  Chapman-Richards distribution is more complicated, and has many more shapes that can be
  attained by reasonable changes to the vital rate parameters.
